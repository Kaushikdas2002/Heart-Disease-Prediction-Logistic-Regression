# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Logistic-Regression

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) using logistic regression. Coronary Heart Disease is a serious health condition, and early prediction can aid in preventive interventions. This project aims to develop a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of an individual having CHD based on various risk factors and health indicators.

## Introduction
Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. This project utilizes logistic regression to build a predictive model for CHD, which can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk and implementing preventive measures.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model contains information about individuals, including age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant health indicators.

## Results
The model's performance on the test set is as follows:

Accuracy: 86%  
Precision: 82%  
Recall: 86%  
F1 Score: 81%
