# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Logistic-Regression
The project aims to build a binary classification model using logistic regression to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease or not based on various medical and lifestyle features. The dataset used in this project contains information about patients, including their age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant attributes that can influence the presence of heart disease.
